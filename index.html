            <p> My love for video games made me curious about:

                <li> How to program video games?</li>
                <li> How to design video games?</li>
                <li> How are programs and websites made?</li>
              </ul>

          <!-- dont forget to us hr-->
            <p>I've been on a journey on finding what I want to do in life <br>
              and I figured out two things. First is games which lead me into coding and <br>
              second is food which one day I hope to open my restaurant. <br>
              But for now, I am fully focused on starting my path to becoming <br>
              a game developer.
            </p>
              <hr>
            <p>As I looked for options to start my coding journey, I found thinkful. <br>
              And I could not be any happier. Their prep course was not only helpful <br>
              in providing great information but also allowing me to hone my skills <br>
              as early as now in coding with their exercises and assessments. 
            </p>
              <hr>
            <p>If ever you are looking for a new game developer or just a helping <br>
            hand. Please reach out! Also if you have any tips on getting better <br>
            I would love to pick your brain. I'm so excited for the new <br>
            opportunities that await.
